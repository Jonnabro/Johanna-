> I am so glad to share that, the project has been recognized globally and many people are using this tool to create their journals, research paper, and personal resume. Students, Lecturers, and Professors from universities like the University of Minnesota, University of Colorado, University of Utah, Cornell University, and even MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center are using this tool for creating documents. A few of you personally thanked me for this project and wished to contribute in the future, which honestly I did not expect myself! Thank you again, for the limitless support!

## Why

Do you use latex as your Resume builder / Research Project / Documentation / Article or any Documentation? Then you probably sometimes wondered in your life if you could use the advantages of git. You could just commit your changes and roll back to older versions anytime you like. When writing a journal, you suddenly remembered you need the section that you deleted earlier. What will you do?

Hasn't it occurred to you that if only you could use your favorite editor VSCode to write your documents? With all the settings you configured, themes you liked and the extensions you probably prefer over your toxic girlfriend?

Think of a moment, your thesis supervisor and co-supervisor wanted to make some changes to your document. What you will do? Email them your document and tell them to reply with the updated version? This is no 80's.

Or, you are in your car, away from your Laptop / Desktop. Suddenly remember you forgot to change the title of your document from "Loren Ipsum" to your actual document title. Won't it be great to modify your document On the Go with your phone? Or in a nerdy way, Apple Watch?

What if you could format your latex codes, automatically, after each save?

And most importantly, what if you could use [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) to automatically complete your latex commands and sentences? Forget the command for a thing? No worry, this tool will guess what could be the next command and will suggest that to you in each step. Not only it complete and suggest commands, but also the full sentence, and Paragraphs! Can you imaging how powerful you can be with this tool?

And do I need to tell you about the usefulness of [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) for built in grammar and spelling checker? Or [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org)? if you prefer open-source?

**Yes! You can do all of these things now with Git, GitHub, Full VSCode Integration, Grammarly, Live Collaboration and Web Support - The WebLatex.**

### Just use overleaf

Yes, but

- In overleaf, you have to pay 40$ to get the git feature which isn't even have the best or full git experience.
- Pay 40$ to collaborate with more than 1 person
- No VSCode, Code formatting, Grammarly, Or Dark Mode / Customization
- GitHub Copilot: Clippy, but a lot better!

## Whats New

- [GitHub Copilot](#github-copilot)
- Added support for the up-to-date texlive-full package. Now, You can stop worrying about package support.

2. Use this as template or Fork.

    - **Use as Template (Recommended):** just Click on `Use this template` and `Create a new Repository` or just      [Click Here](https://github.com/sanjib-sen/weblatex/generate)
    
    Or,

3. Your code will be automatically saved and the PDF will generate automatically each time you edit something
4. You can see all the error logs in the **Terminal > Output > Latex Compiler** as well as in the Latex Workshop sidebar
5. If it shows **Error showing PDF** or in case of any inconvenience, just reload the browser or press `Ctrl+R`

7. Do not delete the `devcontainer.json` file. However you can edit the properties there to customize many things!

## To use with LuaLatex or any other Tex program

Add this line to your main .tex file

```tex
%!TEX program = <tex_program>
```

For example, to use **`LuaLatex`**:

```tex
%!TEX program = lualatex
```

## GitHub Copilot

 Wonderful news, people! [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) has been integrated with this tool, thanks to [@thodson-hugs](https://github.com/thodson-hugs). This program will suggest the next command, sentence and paragraph based on your document and previous writings.

![copilot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54777542/224550711-9927d67f-e63e-445e-9ff0-db7674d7acef.gif)

To turn this off just **remove** or **comment out** the `"GitHub.copilot"` extension from the extensions list in `./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.

  ```json
   "extensions": [
        "...",
        //"GitHub.copilot",
        "..."
        ]
  ```

## Grammarly

This editor has built-in [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) support for `.tex` files.

  ```

If you want to use LanguageTool instead of grammarly, just **uncomment** the following lines from `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

  ```json
  "extensions": [
      "...",
      "valentjn.vscode-ltex",
      "..."
    ]
